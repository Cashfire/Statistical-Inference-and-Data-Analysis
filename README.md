### Course Description
The Coursera course, Data Analysis and Statistical Inference has been revised and is now offered 
as part of Coursera Specialization “Statistics with R”.
 
This Specialization consists of 4 courses and a capstone project. The courses can be taken separately: 
- Introduction to Probability and Data (began in April 2016)
- Inferential Statistics (begins in May 2016)
- Linear Regression and Modeling (begins in June 2016)
- Bayesian Statistics (begins in July 2016) A completely new course, with additional faculty!
- Statistics Capstone Project (August 2016) (for learners who have passed the 4 previous courses, and earned certificate)

 
The Statistics with R team.

___________________________________________________
The goals of this course are as follows:
- Recognize the importance of data collection, identify limitations in data collection methods, and determine how they affect the scope of inference.
- Use statistical software (R) to summarize data numerically and visually, and to perform data analysis.
- Have a conceptual understanding of the unified nature of statistical inference.
- Apply estimation and testing methods (confidence intervals and hypothesis tests) to analyze single variables and the relationship between two variables in order to understand natural phenomena and make data-based decisions.
- Model and investigate relationships between two or more variables within a regression framework.
Interpret results correctly, effectively, and in context without relying on statistical jargon.
Critique data-based claims and evaluate data-based decisions.
Complete a research project that employs simple statistical inference and modeling techniques.

### Distinction Grading Policy <br />
The student’s performance in this course met the standard for Distinction as defined by the course instructor. 

The final grade is based on the average of 6 weekly quizzes (20% of the final grade), 6 lab exercises (15%) a midterm exam (20%), a project (15%) and a final exam (30%). To receive a Statement of Accomplishment with Distinction, you would have to obtain 75% or above.

### Coursera Identity Verification 
Coursera has verified the photo identification and keystroke profile of the student and their successful participation in the course.
